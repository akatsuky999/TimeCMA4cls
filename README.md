## 📌 Repository Description

This repository provides a **classification-task implementation** based on the code of the AAAI 2025 paper:

> **TimeCMA: Towards LLM-Empowered Multivariate Time Series Forecasting via Cross-Modality Alignment**

Originally proposed for **multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF)**, the TimeCMA framework introduces an intuitive and effective **cross-modality alignment mechanism** to leverage large language models (LLMs).  
**In this repository, we adapt and extend the original implementation to support time series classification tasks.**
